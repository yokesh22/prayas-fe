                CB Nursery, a part of the historic Chawda Bagh (est. 1952), began
                with a commitment to improving farm productivity through
                innovation. What started as a nursery for our own farms quickly
                gained attention for the quality of our plants. As demand from
                fellow farmers grew, CB Nursery formally began operations in
                2012â€“13.
                <br />
                <br />
                Today, we are proud to be Central India&apos;s first private
                nursery with an automatic seeding line. Spanning over 30 acres
                across 3 states, our insect-proof, climate-controlled polyhouses
                deliver healthy, high-quality planting material using advanced
                agri-tech solutions.
